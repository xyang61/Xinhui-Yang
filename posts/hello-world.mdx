PI wanted to visit the Space Needle after the dinner. He asked a PhD student to lead our way. We walked about 100 feet before that PhD student found we were going the opposite way. Then our PI asked: 

"Can we get there if we keep going that way?" he asked, pointing in the opposite direction.

"Well, the earth is round, so..." I said.
